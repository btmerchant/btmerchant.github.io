        Nashville Software School is an acclaimed purveyor  of amazing computer coding knowledge.
        The powerful mental muscle that is conveyed and yielded by its students daily is nothing short of    Astounding! Furthermore the swami like prowess of the instructors is mind boggling!
        The schools break room is awsome, they have the king Fish, Top Cat, A Numero Uno coffee maker!
        This thing is like the starship enterprize of the coffee gallaxy! and makes "The richest most flavorful coffee ever".<br>
        OK enough about my school, lets talk about you.    lol...

          Ther are a lot of great students in our class and we are all enthusiastic about becoming code developers.
          We saw a lot of cool project presentations this evening <time>July 8 2015</time> and were inspired
          by what we saw, we even got to sample some great Toffee compliments of one of the app programmers.
          The tough part right now is thinking up content to put in this article so I will leave it at that.

          Learning HTML as well as other languages is difficult mostly because of the mountains of syntax there is to memorize, and in-fact you would need to be one of Stan Lee’s SuperHumans to accomplish that. Fortunately we are not expected to commit it all to memory, just enough to be Dangerous!
          I figure it is like this.. this code was not written to be confusing, I am sure the authors made every attempt possible to make it as intuitive as they could given the obvious constraints.
          Therefore the more of the semantics you learn the closer you get to reaching that point where your brain begins to learn how to interpret the code, and even if you haven’t learned a peticular command it will become more and more intuitive as you progress, in other words “Baby Steps”, learn to walk and after a while you will begin to run. However we can’t all be Olympian track stars…<br><br>
          *** NEVER STOP LEARNING ***

          As we move our train out of the station and down the track to our ultimate destination of super knowledge and success, we know there will be many trials and hazards to overcome but we will soldier on to the promised land where a better more fulfilling job means a better life! And Yes we shall drink more coffee, and eat more pizza, and do this that and the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are Hard As Hell! … yes I said it and it is true this stuff is hard!
          excuse me I got a little emotional!. oh yes .. let us find our way to the ultimate success in the development world… and <br>“God bless us every one”
